\label{sec:design}

Around 5 pages about functional aspects of the FeedApp application.

Concretely, you shall write about 

\begin{itemize}
	\item the \emph{use cases},
	\item the \emph{domain model}, and
	\item the \emph{architecture} (including applied technologies)
\end{itemize}

Each part shall ideally be accompanied with a graphical representation (diagram).

You may have a look at the \href{https://github.com/selabhvl/dat250public/blob/master/projectdescription/README.md}{Examples on GitHub}.

\section{Prototype Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

This section should provide brief details of how the prototype has been implemented.
You may want to use come code snippets here, but only focus on core features and aspects.
You are not meant to copy/paste your whole application code into the report.
Focus for instance how other developers may run your application and how they might develop it further...


The example below shows how you may include code. There are similar
styles for many other langages - in case you do not use Java in your
project. You can wrap the listing into a figure in case you need to
refer to it. How to create a figure was shown in Section~\ref{sec:technology}.
